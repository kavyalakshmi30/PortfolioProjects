📊 **Business Problem**

Walmart's management wants to dive deep into customer purchase behavior during Black Friday. They aim to understand how spending varies by gender and other factors. Do women 💁‍♀️ spend more than men 💁‍♂️? With 50 million male and 50 million female customers, let's uncover the truth! 🔍
